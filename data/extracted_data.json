For low birthweight and exclusive breastfeeding, the categories of \u201coff track \u2013 no progress\u201d and \u201coff track \u2013 worsening\u201d are combined into one\ncategory of \u201coff track \u2013 no progress or worsening\u201d because there is insufficient variation in current progress to split these categories for these indicators.\n2. For exclusive breastfeeding, the actual target is to increase the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding (under six months) to 70 percent by 2030;\nhowever, it has been revised here to reflect the prevalence of non-exclusive breastfeeding so that the concept of the AARR can be applied as it is for the\nother six targets.\n3. The required AARR is based on the change in stunting prevalence corresponding to a 50 percent reduction in the number of children affected by\nstunting between 2012 and 2030, considering the population growth estimated by the United Nations World Population Prospects. Actual AARR is\ncalculated using all years of data between 2012 and 2022.\n4. Regions considered on track are those where the stunting prevalence point estimate or the lower 95 percent confidence interval for 2022 is below\n3 percent.\n5. The required AARR is based on the required change in overweight or wasting prevalence to reduce from the baseline (2012) prevalence to 3 percent by\n2030. Actual AARR is calculated using all years of data between 2012 and 2022. Note that for wasting, unpublished trend estimates from the JME are used to\ngenerate the actual AARR.\n6. Regions where the overweight or wasting prevalence point estimate for 2022 is below 3 percent are considered on track.\n7. The required AARR is based on the change required to reduce the low birthweight prevalence by 30 percent between 2012 (baseline year) and 2030.\nThe same AARR of 1.96 is required for all regions since the target requires a relative change (reduction by 30 percent) in the baseline value. Actual AARR\nis calculated using all years of data between 2012 and 2020.\n8. Regions where the low birthweight prevalence point estimate for 2020 is below 5 percent are considered on track.\n9. The required AARR is based on the required change to decrease the non-exclusive breastfeeding prevalence to 30 percent between 2012 (baseline\nyear) and 2030. Actual AARR is calculated using only two estimates for the years of 2012 and 2021, where the regional averages are population weighted\nusing the most recent estimate for each country between 2005 and 2012 for the 2012 estimate, and between 2016 to 2021 for the 2021 estimate.\n10. Regions where the non-exclusive breastfeeding prevalence point estimate for 2021 is below 30 percent (i.e. where exclusive breastfeeding is\n\u226570 percent) are considered on track.\n11. The global databases for the indicators of stunting, overweight and low birthweight are based on country-level models which provide annual estimates\nfor all countries for generation of regional and global estimates (i.e. annual estimates are even available for countries without any household survey data,\neven in cases where country-modelled estimates are not released to the public and used only for generation of global and regional estimates), thus\nmaking progress assessment possible for all regions.\n12. Progress assessment against the child stunting and child overweight targets is not conducted for countries which did not have any input data (e.g.\nhousehold survey data) to use in the country model which were more recent than 2022, or for which modelled estimates remain pending final review.\n13. Progress assessment is not possible for wasting for regions where population coverage is less than 50 percent. Population coverage is calculated by\ndividing the sum of the population of children under five years for countries with at least one data point from household surveys between 1990 and 2020\nby the total population of children under five years for all countries in the region. Since wasting estimates are generated with a subregional model, even\none year of data between 1990 and 2020 counts towards the regional population coverage.\n14. Progress assessment against the child wasting target is not conducted for countries which do not have at least two data points (e.g. household\nsurveys) between 2005 and 2022, with at least one point being more recent than 2012.\n15. Progress assessment is not possible for exclusive breastfeeding where the population coverage of country survey data for the region is less than\n50 percent for the 2012 and/or the 2021 estimate. For 2012, population coverage is calculated by dividing the sum of the population of children under\nfive years for countries with at least one data point from household surveys between 2005 and 2012 by the total population of children under five years\nfor all countries in the region. For 2021, population coverage is calculated by dividing the sum of the population of children under five years for countries\nwith at least one data point from household surveys between 2016 and 2021.\nSOURCE: Elaborated using information from: WHO & UNICEF. 2017.

It shows that hunger at the global level remained\nrelatively stable between 2021 and 2022, but is still far above pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels and is\nalso rising in many places where people are still struggling to recover income losses in the wake of the\npandemic or have been affected by increasing prices of food, agricultural inputs and energy, conflicts\nand/or extreme climate events. The report also provides updated estimates on the billions of people who\nare unable to access nutritious, safe and sufficient food all year round. Overall, the report shows that we\nare far off track to meet all nutrition targets. While progress on important indicators of child nutrition is\nrevealed, rising overweight among children under five years of age in many countries portends growing\nburdens of non-communicable diseases.\nSince its 2017 edition, this report has repeatedly highlighted that the intensification and interaction of\nconflict, climate extremes and economic slowdowns and downturns, combined with highly unaffordable\nnutritious foods and growing inequality, are pushing us off track to meet the SDG 2 targets. However,\nother important megatrends must also be factored into the analysis to fully understand the challenges to\nand opportunities for meeting the SDG 2 targets. One such megatrend, and the focus of this year\u2019s\nreport, is urbanization.\nUrbanization is increasing in many countries and this report shows it is changing agrifood systems in\nways we can no longer understand using the simple rural\u2013urban divide. The changing pattern of\npopulation agglomerations across a rural\u2013urban continuum and its interface as a place of exchange and\nsocioeconomic interactions, is reshaping and being reshaped by agrifood systems, with implications for\nthe availability and affordability of healthy diets, and in turn, for food security and nutrition.\nNew evidence shows that food purchases in some countries are no longer high only among urban\nhouseholds but also among rural households. Consumption of highly processed foods is also increasing\nin peri-urban and rural areas of some countries. These changes are affecting people\u2019s food security and\nnutrition in ways that differ depending on where they live across the rural\u2013urban continuum.\nThis timely and relevant theme is aligned with the United Nations General Assembly-endorsed New\nUrban Agenda, and the report provides recommendations on the policies, investments and actions\nneeded to address the challenges of agrifood systems transformation under urbanization and to enable\nopportunities for ensuring access to affordable healthy diets for everyone.",

The indicators of\nprogress towards global nutrition targets similarly show that the world is not on track to eliminate all\nforms of malnutrition (SDG Target 2.2). Billions of people still lack access to nutritious, safe and\nsufficient food. The challenges are many, but progress in many countries provides hope that it is possible\nto get back on track towards a world free of hunger and malnutrition.\nPrevious editions of this report have identified the major drivers and underlying structural factors behind\nthese trends and provided evidence-based policy recommendations to revert them, which have been\ngrouped into six transformative pathways that countries can adopt, depending on the drivers and factors\nthey are facing.\nHowever, transiting through any of the six transformative pathways will require proper financing for food\nsecurity and nutrition, the theme of this year\u2019s report. Although there is a broad agreement on the urgent\nneed to increase financing for food security and nutrition, the same cannot be said for a common\nunderstanding regarding how this financing should be defined and tracked. This year the report provides\na long-awaited definition of financing for food security and nutrition and guidance for its implementation.\nThe report underlines that the data available are not enough to provide a full picture of the current\nfinancing flows that are contributing to meet SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2 and of the gap that must be filled\nto fully meet them by 2030. The data for global official development flows are standardized and public,\nbut a comprehensive and comparable analysis of global public spending on food and agriculture is\nchallenged by data gaps, and private financing flows for food security and nutrition are even more\ndifficult to track.\nThe report provides timely and relevant recommendations regarding the efficient use of innovative\nfinancing tools and reforms to the food security and nutrition financing architecture. Establishing a\ncommon ground on how food security and nutrition financing is defined, along with methods for its\ntracking, measurement and implementation, is an important first step towards sustainably increasing the\nfinancing flows needed to end hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, and to ensure access\nto healthy diets for all, today and tomorrow. To this end, insights of this report are particularly important\nin light of the next Summit of the Future in September 2024 and the Fourth International Conference on\nFinancing for Development in June and July 2025.\nThe State of Food Security\nand Nutrition in the World 2024\n(supplementary material)",
